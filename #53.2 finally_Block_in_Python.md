# finally Block and Resource Management


## What Is the finally Block?

The `finally` block:

* **Always executes**
* Runs whether an exception occurs or not
* Is used for **cleanup operations**


`finally` block is important When working with:

* Files
* Database connections
* Network resources

It is the developer’s responsibility to **close resources** properly.


### Syntax

```python
try:
    risky_code
except ExceptionType:
    handling_code
finally:
    cleanup_code
```

## Example with `finally` block

```python
print("Resource opened successfully")

try:
    a = int(input("Enter numerator: "))
    b = int(input("Enter denominator: "))
    result = a / b
    print("Result is:", result)

except ZeroDivisionError as zde:
    print("Division by zero is not allowed.", zde)

except ValueError as ve:
    print("Invalid input.", ve)

finally:
    print("Resource closed.")

print("End of execution")
```


**Output**

```
Resource opened successfully
Enter numerator: 4
Enter denominator: 0
Division by zero is not allowed. division by zero
Resource closed.
End of execution
```

## `finally` Executes Even Without except

```python
try:
    a = int(input("Enter numerator: "))
    b = int(input("Enter denominator: "))
    print(a / b)
finally:
    print("Resource closed.")
```

**Output**

```
Enter numerator: 4
Enter denominator: t
Resource closed.
ValueError: invalid literal for int()
```
