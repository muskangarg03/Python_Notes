# Inner Functions in Python

## What Is an Inner Function?

An **inner function** is a function defined **inside another function**.
It is **local to the outer function** and cannot be accessed directly from outside its scope.

* Inner functions help organize code logically.
* They are commonly used for **helper logic**, **encapsulation**, and **decorators**.


### Scope and Accessibility

* An inner function is **only accessible within its outer function**.
* Trying to call it directly from outside results in a `NameError`.

### Example

```python
def outer():
    print("In outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In inner function")

outer()
inner()
```

**Output**

```
In outer function
NameError: name 'inner' is not defined
```

This happens because `inner()` exists only inside `outer()`.

## Calling an Inner Function from the Outer Function

An inner function can be called **within the outer function itself**.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
    inner()

outer()
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
```


---


## Returning the Result of an Inner Function

If the outer function **calls and returns the inner function’s result**, the return value is passed back.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
        return 5
    return inner()

result = outer()
print(result)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
5
```

**If no value is returned, Python returns `None` by default.**
```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")

    return inner()

result = outer()
print(result)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
None
```


---


## Returning the Inner Function Itself (Closures)

To return the **function itself**, do **not use parentheses**.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
    return inner

func = outer()
print(func)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
<function outer.<locals>.inner at 0x...>
```

Here, `func` now holds a reference to the inner function.


---


## Calling the Returned Inner Function

Once returned, the inner function can be called later.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
    return inner

func = outer()
func()
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
```


---


## Inner Functions with Parameters

Inner functions can accept arguments just like normal functions.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner(num):
        print("In Inner function", num)
    return inner

func = outer()
func(5)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function 5
```

### Closures and Variable Access

When an inner function is returned, it forms a **closure**, meaning:

* It **remembers and can access variables** from the outer function even after the outer function has finished execution.

To **modify** outer variables, use the `nonlocal` keyword.


---

## Why Use Inner Functions?

Inner functions are useful for:

* **Encapsulation** – hiding helper logic inside a function
* **Code organization** – keeping related logic together
* **Closures** – preserving state between function calls
* **Decorators** – modifying function behavior dynamically


---


## Summary

* Inner functions are defined **inside other functions**
* They are **not accessible outside** their outer function
* They can be **called, returned, and assigned to variables**
* Returning an inner function creates a **closure**
* Widely used in **decorators and advanced Python patterns**
