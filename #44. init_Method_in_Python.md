# `__init__` Method in Python

## Understanding `init` method

* `__init__` is a special method in Python. It is **automatically called** when a new object of a class is created.
* Its main purpose is to **initialize instance variables** for the object.

[]


---


## Why `__init__` is Needed?

* To assign **initial values** to object attributes
* To allow **dynamic configuration** of objects
* To ensure each object can have **its own unique data**

Without `__init__`, attributes must be added manually after object creation.


---


## Understanding `self`

* `self` refers to the **current object**
* It allows access to:
  * Instance variables
  * Other methods of the same object
* Variables created using `self` become **object attributes**

```python
self.cpu = cpu
```

➡ This creates an **instance variable**, not a local variable.

## Example:  `__init__` Without Parameters

```python
class Computer:
    def __init__(self):
        print("init called")
        self.cpu = "i5"

    def config(self):
        print("i7", "16GB", "1TB")

com1 = Computer()
com2 = Computer()

print(com1.cpu)
com1.config()
```

### Output:

```
init called
init called
i5
i7 16GB 1TB
```

### Explanation:

* `__init__` runs **once per object**
* `cpu` is an instance variable
* Both objects get their own `cpu` value

## Example: `__init__` With Parameters

Passing parameters allows each object to be created with its own configuration.

```python
class Computer:
    def __init__(self, cpu, ram, ssd):
        print("init called")
        self.cpu = cpu
        self.ram = ram
        self.ssd = ssd

    def config(self):
        print(self.cpu, self.ram, self.ssd)

com1 = Computer("i5", "16GB", "512GB")
com2 = Computer("i9", "96GB", "2TB")

print(com1.cpu)
com1.config()
com2.config()
```

### Output:

```
init called
init called
i5 16GB 512GB
i9 96GB 2TB
```

## What This Demonstrates

* Each object has **its own configuration**
* `__init__` enables **per-object customization**
* Instance variables store **object-specific data**
* Dynamic attributes are created at runtime

---

## Dynamic Attribute Creation

Python allows attributes to be added **even if they are not predefined** in the class.

Example:

```python
obj.webcam = "External"
```

This flexibility is why Python is considered a **dynamic language**.

---

## Real-World Analogy

* Buying a laptop:

  * Some laptops come with a webcam
  * Some require an external webcam
* Similarly, Python objects can have **different attributes** depending on how they are initialized

---

## Important Takeaways

* `__init__` initializes an object after creation
* It is **not a constructor**
* `self` represents the current object
* Instance variables are object-specific
* Class variables are shared
* `__init__` enables clean, dynamic, and scalable object creation

---

## Summary

* `__init__` ensures objects start with meaningful data
* Makes code more **flexible, readable, and maintainable**
* Essential for **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python
