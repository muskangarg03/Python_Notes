# Working with Strings in Python

Strings represent text in Python. When you type something in the interpreter, Python attempts to understand whether it is a number, a variable name, or literal text. Anything intended to be treated as text **must be enclosed in quotes** — otherwise Python interprets it as a variable.


## 1. What Is a String?

A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in:

* **Single quotes** → `'...'`
* **Double quotes** → `"..."`
* **Triple quotes** → `'''...'''` or `"""..."""` (for multi-line text)

Strings allow you to work with names, sentences, file paths, and any other form of textual data.

### Why Quotes Are Needed

If you enter text without quotes, Python assumes it is a variable:

```python
>>> navin
NameError: name 'navin' is not defined
```

To treat it as a string:

```python
>>> 'navin'
'navin'
>>> print('navin')
navin
```

The `print()` function displays only the **content**, without quotes.

### Multi-Line Strings

Triple-quoted strings allow text across multiple lines:

```python
msg = '''
This is a
multi-line string.
'''
print(msg)
```

## Using quotes inside strings

### Apostrophes inside strings

If a string contains `'`, use double quotes outside:

```python
>>> print("navin's laptop")
navin's laptop
```

If you want the same type of quotes inside and outside, **escape** the inner one:

```python
>>> print('navin\'s "laptop"')
navin's "laptop"
```

Incorrect quoting causes:

```python
>>> print('navin's telusko')
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
```

## Escape Sequences in Strings

Python uses backslashes (`\`) for special characters:

* `\n` → Newline
* `\t` → Tab
* `\\` → Literal backslash

Example:

```python
>>> print('Line1\nLine2')
Line1
Line2
```


```python
>>> print('c:\\docs\navin')
c:\docs
avin
```

### Avoiding accidental escape sequences

Windows file paths often cause errors:

```python
>>> print('c:\users\navin')
SyntaxError: (unicode error)
```

Fix with double backslashes:

```python
>>> print('c:\\users\\navin')
c:\users\navin
```


---


## Raw Strings

Raw strings disable escape sequences and treat backslashes literally:

```python
>>> print(r'c:\users\navin')
c:\users\navin
```

> Raw strings cannot end with a single backslash:
> `r"c:\path\"` → ❌ invalid

## String Operations

### a) Concatenation (`+`)

```python
>>> 'navin' + ' reddy'
'navin reddy'
```

Only strings can be concatenated:

```python
>>> 'navin' + 5
TypeError
```

### b) Repetition (`*`)

```python
>>> 'navin ' * 3
'navin navin navin '
```

## Summary

* Strings represent text and must be enclosed in quotes.
* Python errors occur when quotes are mismatched or missing.
* Escape characters like `\n` and `\\` control formatting.
* Use **raw strings (`r'...'`)** to avoid accidental escape processing.
* Strings support operations such as **concatenation** and **repetition**.
* Triple quotes allow easy creation of **multi-line** text blocks.
